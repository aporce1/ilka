[vc_row][vc_column][section_title]Property Payments[/section_title][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]With Realty you can charge a "subscriber" for publishing their properties on your site, rather than giving this option for free.

Users with a role of "admin" or "agent" are considered in-house and there for always submit properties for free. To charge a third party make sure their user role is set to "subscriber".

Charge subscribers per-listing or for any of your membership packages (see below for more details). You can also choose beween one-time and recurring subscriptions.

Supported payment methods are PayPal and Stripe. Payment settings are located under "Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Property Submit".[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_single_image image="1033" img_size="thumbnail-16-9" add_caption="yes" onclick="link_image"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_separator][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_single_image image="1050" img_size="thumbnail-16-9" add_caption="yes" onclick="link_image"][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_custom_heading text="Pay Per Listing" font_container="tag:h3|text_align:left" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]The most basic way to charge subscribers is on a per-property basis. Set any amount and choose between one-time or recurring payments. To mark a property as "Featured" you can charge additionally.

When submitting  a property the user is informed upfront via a notification about the payment terms. After submitting a property, payment methods are provided.

Either one-time or with a recurring subscription. Subscription periods are freely customizable.

On the right you can see two example packages we have created for this demo. If you login as "demo" user and try to publish a property you will see the remaining quota for the purchased packaged yourself.

A click on the "Subscribe" button leads you to the package detail page, where you can read more about the package and proceed to make a payment.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][membership_packages columns="2"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
